# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the OpenShift Agent-Based Installer Helper project. This utility provides automation and configuration management to simplify the usage of the OpenShift Agent-Based Installer.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. It provides a record of what was decided, why it was decided, and how it impacts the project.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:
- Title and status
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Implementation details
- Related documentation and test cases
